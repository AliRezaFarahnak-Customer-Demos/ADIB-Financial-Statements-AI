The actuarial valuations estimate the current value of benefits earned and use various actuarial assumptions in the process. When actual experience varies from estimates or when actuarial assumptions change, actuarial gains or losses arise. Actuarial gains and losses are not recognized immediately but rather over time. This account is used to record the portion of the actuarial gains and losses recognized during the year.","","097 - Receiver General"
